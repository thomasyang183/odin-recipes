          Make the Sauce: Combine all of the sauce ingredients and stir to
          dissolve the sugar. The warm broth will help the sugar to dissolve
          easily.

          Cook Chicken: Cut chicken into small 3/4â€³ bite-sized pieces and season
          lightly with black pepper. Heat a large heavy skillet over medium-high
          heat with 1 Tbsp oil. Add chicken and cook 1 minute undisturbed then
          stir fry 5 minutes until golden and just cooked through. Remove
          chicken to a bowl.

          Sautee Veggies: In the same skillet over medium-high heat, add 1 Tbsp
          oil, broccoli florets, sliced onion and mushrooms and stir fry 3
          minutes until mushrooms are softened then reduce heat.

          Add Stir Fry Sauce: Give the sauce a quick stir in case there was
          settling and add it to the skillet. Simmer the sauce over medium/low
          heat for 3-4 minutes until thickened and garlic and ginger have
          mellowed in flavor. To thin the sauce, add water as needed and you can
          add more soy sauce to taste.
        </p>

          Return Chicken to the Pan and stir until heated through then serve
          over white rice garnished with sesame seeds if desired.
